Our proposed FFA model is trained on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/indoor-training-set-its-residestandard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RESIDE Dataset</a>

The results formulated below are from 
<i>Boyi Li, Wenqi Ren, Dengpan Fu, Dacheng Tao, Dan Feng, Wenjun Zeng, and Zhangyang Wang. 2019. Benchmarking Single-Image Dehazing and Beyond. Trans. Img. Proc. 28, 1 (Jan. 2019), 492â€“505. https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2867951<i>

Since working with only CPU, we are yet to refine the model more and make our results best.
Below are the results of our model:

#### Also we have created the flask website for the same, It might stop working after January 2025 as its subscription will end,
#### so we have made the working of our website below:

This is our browse option:

We also have added sample images to process directly:
